This project is a menu-driven Electricity Billing System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling. The application enables users to generate electricity bills for Residential and Commercial customers by collecting validated customer details such as customer ID, name, contact number, and electricity units consumed. The total bill is calculated automatically based on predefined rates and fixed charges for each customer type. All billing records are stored permanently in a file, allowing users to view previously generated bills even after the program is closed. This project demonstrates practical implementation of core C++ concepts including classes and objects, encapsulation, input validation, static member functions, and file operations, making it suitable for academic submissions, viva examinations, and GitHub portfolios.
